Titanic Survival Rate Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. The dataset is provided by Kaggle's Titanic competition.

🚀 Objective
Build a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, class, and more.

🧠 Features Used
PassengerId

Pclass (Ticket class)

Sex

Age

SibSp (No. of siblings / spouses aboard)

Parch (No. of parents / children aboard)

Fare

Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

🧪 ML Workflow
Data Cleaning & Imputation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Submission CSV generation
